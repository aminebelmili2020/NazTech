Storys=['''     1.      A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.
    My boy, said his mother, be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. 
        Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.Do not attempt too much at once.''',

        '''     2.     ONE fine evening, a no less fine government clerk called Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov was sitting in the second row of the stalls, gazing through an opera glass at the Cloches de Corneville. He gazed and felt at the acme of bliss. 
        But suddenly.. In stories one so often meets with this "But suddenly.
            The authors are right: life is so full of surprises! But suddenly his face puckered up, his eyes disappeared, his breathing was arrested..
            he took the opera glass from his eyes, bent over and... Aptchee!! he sneezed as you perceive. 
                It is not reprehensible for anyone to sneeze anywhere. Peasants sneeze and so do police superintendents, 
                and sometimes even privy councillors. All men sneeze. Tchervyakov was not in the least confused, 
                he wiped his face with his handkerchief, and like a polite man, 
                looked round to see whether he had disturbed any one by his sneezing. 
                But then he was overcome with confusion. He saw that an old gentleman sitting in front of him in the first row of the stalls was carefully wiping his bald head and his neck with his glove and muttering something to himself. 
                In the old gentleman, Tchervyakov recognised Brizzhalov, a civilian general serving in the Department of Transport.''']
